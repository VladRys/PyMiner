## PyMiner [1.0.0]

First public release of my PyMiner fork. The project has been refactored from a procedural script into a structured, object-oriented design, providing a foundation for modular development and future feature expansion.

### Key Changes

- **OOP Refactor**
    - Core logic encapsulated in `Game`, `GameState`, and `Saves`.
    - Removed global state and procedural functions.

- **Item System**
    - Items moved to `items` module.
    - Inventory stores `Item` objects, enabling extensible item behavior.
    - Loot generation is dynamic via `loot_generator`.

- **Game Mechanics**
    - Mining animation simplified with looped display.
    - Inventory and upgrades fully integrated with `GameState`.
    - Item prices derived from object properties instead of hardcoded values.

- **Save System**
    - Centralized management using `Saves` class.
    - Consistent load and write operations on exit and updates.

### Removed / Deprecated

- Hardcoded item strings in main code.

- `math.trunc` usage for currency display.

Fixed

- Inventory overflow now prevents mining beyond capacity.
- Save file writes are consistent and reliable.
